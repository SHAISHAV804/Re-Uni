## Inspiration The amount of initial internships available for freshers. ## What it does 1. Where ever we go we required some id proofs so instead of that we can use this website so that we don't face any problem at our work place. 2. Authorization for colleges. ## How we built it We built using react js, node js and for database we use MySQL. ## Challenges we ran into 1. Linking with react js 2.Database issues ## Accomplishments that we're proud of We're proud to solved 400+ errors. ## What we learned 1. How to do teamwork. 2. Resolving problems ## What's next for Re-Uni To make 1st Re-Uni of the world and not the next linkedin of the world.
